name: Delete a channel, or close a private message. Requires the MANAGE_CHANNELS
  permission for the guild, or MANAGE_THREADS if the channel is a thread.
  Deleting a category does not delete its child channels; they will have their
  parent_id removed and a Channel Update Gateway event will fire for each of
  them. Returns a channel object on success. Fires a Channel Delete Gateway
  event (or Thread Delete if the channel was a thread).
